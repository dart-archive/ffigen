Binding generator for [FFI](https://dart.dev/guides/libraries/c-interop) bindings.

> Note: ffigen only supports parsing `C` headers.

## Example

For some header file _example.h_:
```C
int sum(int a, int b);
```
Add configurations to Pubspec File:
```yaml
ffigen:
  output: 'generated_bindings.dart'
  headers:
    entry-points:
      - 'example.h'
```
Output (_generated_bindings.dart_).
```dart
class NativeLibrary {
  final Pointer<T> Function<T extends NativeType>(String symbolName)
      _lookup;
  NativeLibrary(DynamicLibrary dynamicLibrary)
      : _lookup = dynamicLibrary.lookup;
  NativeLibrary.fromLookup(
      Pointer<T> Function<T extends NativeType>(String symbolName)
          lookup)
      : _lookup = lookup;

  int sum(int a, int b) {
    return _sum(a, b);
  }

  late final _sumPtr = _lookup<ffi.NativeFunction<ffi.Int32 Function(ffi.Int32, ffi.Int32)>>('sum');
  late final _sum = _sum_ptr.asFunction<int Function(int, int)>();
}
```
## Using this package
- Add `ffigen` under `dev_dependencies` in your `pubspec.yaml`.
- Install LLVM (see [Installing LLVM](#installing-llvm)).
- Configurations must be provided in `pubspec.yaml` or in a custom YAML file (see [configurations](#configurations)).
- Run the tool- `dart run ffigen`.

Jump to [FAQ](#faq).

## Installing LLVM
`package:ffigen` uses LLVM. Install LLVM (9+) in the following way.

#### ubuntu/linux
1. Install libclangdev - `sudo apt-get install libclang-dev`.

#### Windows
1. Install Visual Studio with C++ development support.
2. Install [LLVM](https://releases.llvm.org/download.html) or `winget install -e --id LLVM.LLVM`.

#### MacOS
1. Install Xcode.
2. Install LLVM - `brew install llvm`.

## Configurations
Configurations can be provided in 2 ways-
1. In the project's `pubspec.yaml` file under the key `ffigen`.
2. Via a custom YAML file, then specify this file while running -
`dart run ffigen --config config.yaml`

## Limitations
1. Multi OS support for types such as long. [Issue #7](https://github.com/dart-lang/ffigen/issues/7)

## Trying out examples
1. `cd examples/<example_u_want_to_run>`, Run `dart pub get`.
2. Run `dart run ffigen`.

## Running Tests
1. Dynamic library for some tests need to be built before running the examples.
  1. `cd test/native_test`.
  2. Run `dart build_test_dylib.dart`.

Run tests from the root of the package with `dart run test`.
> Note: If llvm is not installed in one of the default locations, tests may fail.
## FAQ
### Can ffigen be used for removing underscores or renaming declarations?
Ffigen supports **regexp based renaming**, the regexp must be a
full match, for renaming you can use regexp groups (`$1` means group 1).

E.g - For renaming `clang_dispose_string` to `string_dispose`.
We can can match it using `clang_(.*)_(.*)` and rename with `$2_$1`.

Here's an example of how to remove prefix underscores from any struct and its members.
```yaml
structs:
  ...
  rename:
    '_(.*)': '$1' # Removes prefix underscores from all structures.
  member-rename:
    '.*': # Matches any struct.
      '_(.*)': '$1' # Removes prefix underscores from members.
```
### How to generate declarations only from particular headers?
The default behaviour is to include everything directly/transitively under
each of the `entry-points` specified.

If you only want to have declarations directly particular header you can do so
using `include-directives`. You can use **glob matching** to match header paths.
```yaml
headers:
  entry-points:
    - 'path/to/my_header.h'
  include-directives:
    - '**my_header.h' # This glob pattern matches the header path.
```
### Can ffigen filter declarations by name?
Ffigen supports including/excluding declarations using full regexp matching.

Here's an example to filter functions using names
```yaml
functions:
  include:
    - 'clang.*' # Include all functions starting with clang.
  exclude:
    - '.*dispose': # Exclude all functions ending with dispose.
```
This will include `clang_help`. But will exclude `clang_dispose`.

Note: exclude overrides include.
### How does ffigen handle C Strings?

Ffigen treats `char*` just as any other pointer,(`Pointer<Int8>`).
To convert these to/from `String`, you can use [package:ffi](https://pub.dev/packages/ffi). Use `ptr.cast<Utf8>().toDartString()` to convert `char*` to dart `string` and `"str".toNativeUtf8()` to convert `string` to `char*`.
### How does ffigen handle C99 bool data type?

Although `dart:ffi` doesn't have a NativeType for `bool`, they can be implemented as `Uint8`.
Ffigen generates dart `bool` for function parameters and return type by default.
To disable this, and use `int` instead, set `dart-bool: false` in configurations.

### How are unnamed enums handled?

Unnamed enums are handled separately, under the key `unnamed-enums`, and are generated as top level constants.

Here's an example that shows how to include/exclude/rename unnamed enums
```yaml
unnamed-enums:
  include:
    - 'CX_.*'
  exclude:
    - '.*Flag'
  rename:
    'CXType_(.*)': '$1'
```

### Why are some struct/union declarations generated even after excluded them in config?

This happens when an excluded struct/union is a dependency to some included declaration.
(A dependency means a struct is being passed/returned by a function or is member of another struct in some way)

Note: If you supply `structs` -> `dependency-only` as `opaque` ffigen will generate
these struct dependencies as `Opaque` if they were only passed by reference(pointer).
```yaml
structs:
  dependency-only: opaque
unions:
  dependency-only: opaque
```

### How to expose the native pointers?

By default the native pointers are private, but you can use the
`symbol-address` subkey for functions/globals and make them public by matching with its name. The pointers are then accesible via `nativeLibrary.addresses`.

Example -
```yaml
functions:
  symbol-address:
    include:
      - 'myFunc' # Match function name.
      - '.*' # Do this to expose all function pointers.
    exclude: # If you only use exclude, then everything not excluded is generated.
      - 'dispose'
```

### How to get typedefs to Native and Dart type of a function?

By default these types are inline. But you can use the `expose-typedef` subkey
for functions to generate them. This will expose the Native and Dart type.
E.g - for a function named `hello`, the generated typedefs are named
as `NativeHello` and `DartHello`.

Example -
```yaml
functions:
  expose-typedefs:
    include:
      - 'myFunc' # Match function name.
      - '.*' # Do this to expose types for all function.
    exclude: # If you only use exclude, then everything not excluded is generated.
      - 'dispose'
```

### How are Structs/Unions/Enums that are reffered to via typedefs handled?

Named declarations use their own names even when inside another typedef.
However, unnamed declarations inside typedefs take the name of the _first_ typedef
that refers to them.

### Why are some typedefs not generated?

The following typedefs are not generated -
- They are not referred to anywhere in the included declarations.
- They refer to a struct/union having the same name as itself.
- They refer to a boolean, enum, inline array, Handle or any unsupported type.
