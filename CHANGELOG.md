# 6.0.1

- Replace path separators in `include-directives` before matching file names.

# 6.0.0

and `ffi.Bool` as it's Dart and C Type respectively.

# 5.0.1

- Add a the xcode tools llvm as default path on MacOS.

# 5.0.0

- Stable release targeting Dart 2.17, supporting ABI-specific integer types.

  might change at any point. Feel free to report bugs if encountered.

- Added config keys - `library-imports` and `type-map`.

# 4.1.3
- Analyzer fixes.

- Added fix for empty include list to exclude all

# 4.1.1
- Added fix for errors due to name collision between member name
and type name used internally in structs/unions.

# 4.1.0

# 4.0.0-dev.2
- Added config key `functions -> expose-typedefs` to expose the typedef
to Native and Dart type.
- Config key `function`->`symbol-address` no longer exposes the typedef
to Native type. Use `expose-typedefs` to get the native type.

# 4.0.0-dev.1
- This package now targets package:lints for the generated code. The generated
code uses C symbol names as is. Use either `// ignore_for_file: lintRule1, lintRule2`
in the `preamble`, or rename the symbols to make package:lints happy.
- Name collisions are now resolved by suffixing `<int>` instead of `_<int>`.

# 4.0.0-dev.0
- Added support for generating typedefs (_referred_ typedefs only).

- All declarations that are excluded by the user are now only included if being
used somewhere.

# 0.1.4
- Comments config now has a style and length sub keys - `style: doxygen(default) | any`, `length: brief | full(default)`, and can be disabled by passing `comments: false`.
